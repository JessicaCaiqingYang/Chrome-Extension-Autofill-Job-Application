## Key Integration Features Implemented

### 1. Unified Notification System
```typescript
// Centralized notification management
const { addNotification, removeNotification } = useNotifications();

// Consistent notification patterns
showSuccess('Profile Saved', 'Your changes have been saved');
showAutofillSuccess(fieldsCount);
showError('Operation Failed', 'Please try again');
```

### 2. Real-time Status Tracking
```typescript
// Activity logging across components
await addActivityEntry({
  action: 'autofill_completed',
  details: `Filled ${fieldsCount} fields`,
  fieldsCount,
  success: true,
  url: currentPage
});
```

### 3. Cross-Component Communication
```typescript
// Message passing for real-time updates
chrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener((message, sender, sendResponse) => {
  if (message.type === MessageType.AUTOFILL_COMPLETE) {
    handleAutofillComplete(message.payload);
    updateStatusAcrossComponents();
  }
});
```

### 4. Consistent Design System Application
```typescript
// Shared styling utilities
const buttonStyle = mergeStyles(
  buttonStyles.base,
  buttonStyles.primary,
  { fontSize: typography.fontSize.sm }
);
```

## Workflow Validation

### Complete User Journey Tested:
1. **Extension Load** → Status tab shows proper initialization
2. **Profile Setup** → Real-time validation and auto-save
3. **CV Upload** → File processing with progress feedback
4. **Autofill Configuration** → Toggle integration with notifications
5. **Form Filling** → Real-time status updates and success notifications
6. **Error Scenarios** → Proper error handling and user guidance

### Cross-Component Data Flow:
- Profile changes → Status updates → Activity logging
- Autofill actions → Notifications → Status tracking
- Error states → User feedback → Recovery guidance
- Settings changes → Real-time reflection across tabs

## Accessibility Features Implemented

### ✅ Keyboard Navigation
- Full tab navigation with arrow key support
- Proper focus management and visual indicators
- Home/End key navigation for tab lists
- Enter/Space key activation for interactive elements

### ✅ Screen Reader Support
- ARIA labels and roles throughout the interface
- Live regions for dynamic content announcements
- Proper form field associations
- Descriptive button and link text

### ✅ Form Accessibility
- Floating labels with proper associations
- Real-time validation feedback
- Required field indicators
- Error message associations

## Performance Optimizations

### Bundle Size Management
- **Popup**: 98.71 KB (within 500KB limit)
- **Background**: 8.37 KB (within 200KB limit)  
- **Content Script**: 14.55 KB (within 100KB limit)

### Runtime Performance
- Efficient re-rendering with React optimization
- Debounced auto-save functionality
- Optimized notification system with cleanup
- Minimal DOM manipulation in content scripts

## Security & Privacy Integration

### Data Handling
