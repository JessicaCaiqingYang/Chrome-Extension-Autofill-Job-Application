# Product Overview

Job Application Autofill is a Chrome extension that automatically fills job application forms with stored user profile data. The extension helps job seekers streamline their application process by:

- Storing personal information, work experience, and skills in a user profile
- Uploading and parsing CV/resume files (PDF and DOCX formats)
- Automatically detecting and filling form fields on job application websites
- Providing a React-based popup interface for profile management
- Supporting toggle controls for autofill functionality

The extension uses Chrome Manifest V3 and operates across all websites with appropriate permissions to detect and fill job application forms.
