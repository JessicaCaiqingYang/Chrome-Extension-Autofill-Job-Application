# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Job Application Autofill extension currently accepts CV/resume file uploads but does not extract text content from PDF and DOCX files. Users can upload files, but the system only stores placeholder text instead of parsing the actual document content. This feature will implement proper text extraction from PDF and DOCX files to enable meaningful autofill functionality based on the user's actual CV content.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a job seeker, I want to upload my PDF resume and have the extension extract the text content, so that the autofill feature can use my actual resume information to fill job application forms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads a PDF file THEN the system SHALL extract readable text content from the PDF
2. WHEN the PDF text extraction is successful THEN the system SHALL store the extracted text in the CVData object
3. WHEN the PDF text extraction fails THEN the system SHALL provide a clear error message to the user
4. WHEN the extracted text is empty or contains only whitespace THEN the system SHALL reject the file with an appropriate error message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a job seeker, I want to upload my Word document resume (DOCX format) and have the extension extract the text content, so that I can use my existing resume format for autofill functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads a DOCX file THEN the system SHALL extract readable text content from the Word document
2. WHEN the DOCX text extraction is successful THEN the system SHALL store the extracted text in the CVData object
3. WHEN the DOCX text extraction fails THEN the system SHALL provide a clear error message to the user
4. WHEN the extracted text contains formatting artifacts THEN the system SHALL clean the text to remove unnecessary formatting characters

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a job seeker, I want the CV parsing to work reliably in the Chrome extension environment, so that I can trust the extension to process my documents correctly without browser compatibility issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension runs in Chrome THEN the PDF parsing SHALL work without requiring additional browser permissions
2. WHEN the extension runs in Chrome THEN the DOCX parsing SHALL work without requiring additional browser permissions
3. WHEN parsing libraries are loaded THEN they SHALL be compatible with Chrome extension Manifest V3 requirements
4. WHEN parsing operations occur THEN they SHALL complete within a reasonable time limit (under 10 seconds for typical CV files)

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a job seeker, I want clear feedback during the CV processing, so that I understand what's happening and can troubleshoot any issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a CV file is being processed THEN the system SHALL show a loading indicator to the user
2. WHEN text extraction is successful THEN the system SHALL display a success message with the filename
3. WHEN text extraction fails THEN the system SHALL display a specific error message explaining what went wrong
4. WHEN the extracted text is available THEN the system SHALL allow the user to preview a portion of the extracted content

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a job seeker, I want the system to handle various CV file formats gracefully, so that I don't encounter unexpected errors when uploading different types of documents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads an unsupported file type THEN the system SHALL reject it with a clear error message
2. WHEN a user uploads a corrupted PDF or DOCX file THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully without crashing
3. WHEN a user uploads a password-protected PDF THEN the system SHALL inform the user that password-protected files are not supported
4. WHEN a user uploads a very large file THEN the system SHALL enforce size limits and provide appropriate feedback
