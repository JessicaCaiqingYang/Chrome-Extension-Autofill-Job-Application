# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Enable parsing library imports and basic setup
  - Uncomment the pdf-parse, mammoth, and Buffer imports in service-worker.ts
  - Add proper TypeScript type imports for the parsing libraries
  - Verify that the libraries load correctly in the Chrome extension environment
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2_

- [ ] 2. Implement PDF text extraction functionality
  - Create a dedicated PDF parsing function that converts File to Buffer and uses pdf-parse
  - Add proper error handling for corrupted PDFs and parsing failures
  - Implement text cleaning to remove excessive whitespace and normalize line breaks
  - Write unit tests for PDF parsing with various file types
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4_

- [ ] 3. Implement DOCX text extraction functionality
  - Create a dedicated DOCX parsing function using mammoth library
  - Configure mammoth to extract plain text while preserving paragraph structure
  - Add error handling for corrupted DOCX files and parsing failures
  - Write unit tests for DOCX parsing with various formatting scenarios
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_

- [ ] 4. Enhance error handling and validation
  - Implement specific error codes for different failure scenarios (corrupted files, password-protected, etc.)
  - Add content validation to ensure extracted text meets minimum requirements
  - Create user-friendly error messages for each error type
  - Add timeout handling for parsing operations that take too long
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 2.3, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4_

- [ ] 5. Add extraction metadata and performance tracking
  - Extend CVData interface to include extraction metadata (word count, processing time, etc.)
  - Implement processing time measurement for performance monitoring
  - Add word count calculation for extracted text
  - Store extraction method information for debugging purposes
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 3.4_

- [ ] 6. Implement text processing and cleaning pipeline
  - Create text normalization functions to clean extracted content
  - Add detection and removal of common document artifacts (page numbers, headers)
  - Implement minimum content length validation
  - Add special character handling and encoding normalization
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 2.4, 4.3_

- [ ] 7. Update UI feedback and user experience
  - Modify CVUploader component to show processing status during text extraction
  - Add success messages that include extraction metadata (word count, processing time)
  - Implement error message display with specific error details
  - Add option to preview extracted text content in the UI
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [ ] 8. Add comprehensive error handling for edge cases
  - Implement handling for password-protected PDF files with appropriate error messages
  - Add graceful handling of extremely large files that exceed processing capabilities
  - Create fallback mechanisms for partial text extraction when full parsing fails
  - Add detection and handling of empty or whitespace-only documents
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4_

- [ ] 9. Implement integration tests for end-to-end functionality
  - Create test files (sample PDFs and DOCX files) for testing various scenarios
  - Write integration tests that verify the complete upload-to-storage flow
  - Test error scenarios with corrupted and invalid files
  - Verify that extracted text is properly stored and retrievable
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2, 3.1, 3.2_

- [ ] 10. Performance optimization and final testing
  - Add performance monitoring to track parsing times for different file sizes
  - Implement memory usage optimization for large file processing
  - Test with various file sizes up to the 5MB limit
  - Verify Chrome extension compatibility across different Chrome versions
  - _Requirements: 3.3, 3.4_
