# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves building a Chrome extension using Manifest V3, React, Vite, and TypeScript that automates the process of filling job application forms. The extension will provide a popup interface where users can manage their profile information and CV, and then automatically populate job application forms with their stored data through intelligent field mapping.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a job seeker, I want to store my profile information in the extension, so that I can quickly autofill job applications without manually entering the same data repeatedly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the extension popup THEN the system SHALL display a form for entering profile information
2. WHEN the user enters profile data (name, email, phone, address, etc.) THEN the system SHALL store this information locally in the browser
3. WHEN the user reopens the popup THEN the system SHALL display previously saved profile information
4. IF the user modifies existing profile data THEN the system SHALL update the stored information

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a job seeker, I want to upload and store my CV in PDF or Word format, so that the extension can extract relevant information for autofilling applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks the CV upload button THEN the system SHALL open a file picker for PDF and Word documents
2. WHEN the user selects a valid CV file THEN the system SHALL store the file locally in the browser
3. WHEN a CV is uploaded THEN the system SHALL extract text content from the document
4. IF the user uploads a new CV THEN the system SHALL replace the previously stored CV
5. WHEN the popup is opened THEN the system SHALL display the name of the currently stored CV file

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a job seeker, I want to toggle autofill functionality on and off, so that I can control when the extension attempts to fill forms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the popup THEN the system SHALL display a toggle switch for autofill functionality
2. WHEN the user clicks the toggle switch THEN the system SHALL enable or disable autofill mode
3. WHEN autofill is enabled THEN the system SHALL visually indicate the active state in the popup
4. WHEN autofill is disabled THEN the system SHALL not attempt to fill any forms on web pages

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a job seeker, I want the extension to automatically detect and fill job application form fields, so that I can complete applications quickly and accurately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN autofill is enabled AND the user is on a job application page THEN the system SHALL scan for fillable form fields
2. WHEN form fields are detected THEN the system SHALL attempt to map them to stored user data based on field attributes and labels
3. WHEN a field mapping is successful THEN the system SHALL populate the field with the appropriate user data
4. IF a field cannot be mapped automatically THEN the system SHALL leave the field unchanged
5. WHEN the autofill process completes THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback indicating which fields were filled

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a job seeker, I want the extension to work across different job sites and application forms, so that I can use it universally for my job search.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension encounters different form structures THEN the system SHALL use flexible field detection methods
2. WHEN common field types are present (name, email, phone, address, etc.) THEN the system SHALL recognize them regardless of specific HTML attributes
3. WHEN the extension runs on any job site THEN the system SHALL function without site-specific configuration
4. IF a form uses non-standard field naming THEN the system SHALL attempt intelligent matching based on context clues

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a job seeker, I want my data to be stored securely and privately, so that my personal information remains protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user data is stored THEN the system SHALL use Chrome's local storage APIs
2. WHEN data is stored THEN the system SHALL not transmit any personal information to external servers
3. WHEN the extension is uninstalled THEN the system SHALL remove all stored user data
4. IF the user clears browser data THEN the system SHALL handle missing data gracefully

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a job seeker, I want the extension to automatically upload my stored CV file to file upload fields on job application websites, so that I don't have to manually browse and select my CV for each application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN autofill is enabled AND the system detects a file upload field for CV/resume THEN the system SHALL automatically upload the stored CV file
2. WHEN a file upload field is detected THEN the system SHALL identify it as a CV/resume upload based on field attributes, labels, or context
3. WHEN the stored CV file is uploaded THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback indicating successful upload
4. IF no CV is stored THEN the system SHALL skip file upload fields and optionally notify the user
5. WHEN multiple file upload fields are present THEN the system SHALL upload the CV to fields identified as resume/CV uploads
6. IF a file upload field has restrictions (file type, size) THEN the system SHALL validate the stored CV meets requirements before upload
7. WHEN file upload fails THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate error feedback and continue with other autofill operations

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a job seeker, I want clear visual feedback about the extension's status and actions, so that I understand what the extension is doing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension is active on a page THEN the system SHALL display a visual indicator
2. WHEN autofill is triggered THEN the system SHALL show progress or completion status
3. WHEN fields are successfully filled THEN the system SHALL highlight or indicate the filled fields
4. IF errors occur during autofill THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages
5. WHEN the popup is opened THEN the system SHALL show the current status of stored data and settings
