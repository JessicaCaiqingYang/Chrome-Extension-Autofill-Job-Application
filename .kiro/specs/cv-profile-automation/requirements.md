# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the job application autofill Chrome extension by removing the status tab from the popup interface and implementing intelligent CV processing that automatically extracts and populates user profile information from uploaded CV documents. The system will parse CV content to identify personal details, work experience, education, and skills, then automatically populate the profile form fields to minimize manual data entry.

## Requirements

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the extension popup THEN the system SHALL display only the essential tabs (Profile, CV Upload) without the status tab
2. WHEN the user navigates through the popup THEN the system SHALL provide a streamlined interface focused on core functionality
3. WHEN the extension needs to show status information THEN the system SHALL integrate status indicators directly into relevant sections rather than a separate tab
4. IF the user needs diagnostic information THEN the system SHALL provide this through contextual notifications or error messages within existing tabs

### Requirement 2

4. IF the system cannot extract certain information THEN the system SHALL leave those fields empty for manual entry
5. WHEN multiple pieces of similar information are found THEN the system SHALL use the most recent or prominent instance

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a job seeker, I want the system to extract my work experience from my CV, so that employment history is automatically populated in my profile.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the CV contains employment history THEN the system SHALL identify job titles, company names, employment dates, and job descriptions
2. WHEN work experience is extracted THEN the system SHALL organize it chronologically with most recent positions first
3. WHEN job descriptions are found THEN the system SHALL extract key responsibilities and achievements for each role
4. IF employment dates are in various formats THEN the system SHALL normalize them to a consistent format
5. WHEN the extraction is complete THEN the system SHALL populate work experience fields in the profile form

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a job seeker, I want my education information automatically extracted from my CV, so that my academic background is populated without manual entry.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the CV contains education information THEN the system SHALL identify degree types, institution names, graduation dates, and fields of study
2. WHEN multiple degrees are present THEN the system SHALL organize them chronologically or by relevance
3. WHEN GPA or honors information is available THEN the system SHALL extract and include this data
4. IF education dates are missing or unclear THEN the system SHALL extract available information and flag incomplete entries
5. WHEN certifications or additional training are mentioned THEN the system SHALL include these in the education section

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a job seeker, I want my skills and competencies extracted from my CV, so that my technical and professional abilities are automatically cataloged.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the CV contains skills sections THEN the system SHALL identify technical skills, soft skills, and professional competencies
2. WHEN skills are mentioned throughout the document THEN the system SHALL aggregate them from various sections including job descriptions and summaries
3. WHEN skill proficiency levels are indicated THEN the system SHALL capture and preserve this information
4. IF duplicate skills are found THEN the system SHALL consolidate them and use the highest proficiency level mentioned
5. WHEN the skills extraction is complete THEN the system SHALL organize skills by category (technical, language, soft skills, etc.)

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a job seeker, I want to review and edit the automatically extracted information, so that I can ensure accuracy and completeness before using it for applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CV parsing completes THEN the system SHALL display all extracted information in editable form fields
2. WHEN the user reviews extracted data THEN the system SHALL highlight which fields were auto-populated versus manually entered
3. WHEN the user makes corrections THEN the system SHALL save the edited information and preserve user modifications
4. IF the user wants to re-extract from the same CV THEN the system SHALL provide an option to re-parse while preserving manual edits
5. WHEN the user is satisfied with the profile THEN the system SHALL save the complete profile for use in autofill operations

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a job seeker, I want the CV parsing to handle different document formats and layouts, so that the extraction works regardless of how my resume is formatted.

5. WHEN parsing fails or produces poor results THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback and allow manual profile entry

### Requirement 8

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CV parsing begins THEN the system SHALL display a progress indicator showing the extraction process
2. WHEN parsing completes successfully THEN the system SHALL show a summary of extracted information categories and field counts
3. WHEN certain information cannot be extracted THEN the system SHALL notify the user about missing or unclear sections
4. IF parsing encounters errors THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages with suggestions for resolution
5. WHEN the user wants to understand the extraction process THEN the system SHALL provide tooltips or help text explaining how information was identified
